### Data 
[clean_data.csv.csv](https://github.com/asmaaalaa99/SS154-Final-Project/blob/main/clean_data.csv "Database_clean_data.csv") contains the pre-processed dataset that is used for modeling the effect of city size and post-grad earnings. We use [College Scorecard Dataset of 2021](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)  and [Census Data of 2019 ](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-cities-and-towns.html) 
###  Data Processing 
We process the two dataset using Python and documented the code in [datacleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/asmaaalaa99/SS154-Final-Project/blob/main/datacleaning.ipynb "datacleaning.ipynb") 

###  Stata Modeling 
We model the effects of city size on earnings using an ordinary least squares regression in Stata and documented our code in [stata_code.do ](https://github.com/asmaaalaa99/SS154-Final-Project/blob/main/stata_code.do "stata_code.do ")
